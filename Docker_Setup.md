# Docker setup

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for setting up Docker on your machine. Docker is a platform that allows you to automate the deployment and management of applications within containers. Follow the steps below to get Docker up and running:

1. **Step 1: Install Docker**

- <u>Check System Requirements:</u> Before installing Docker, ensure that your machine meets the system requirements. Visit the Docker documentation or the Docker website for specific requirements based on your operating system.

- <u>Download Docker:</u> Go to the Docker website (https://www.docker.com) and download the appropriate Docker version for your operating system. Docker provides versions for Windows, macOS, and Linux distributions.

- <u>Install Docker:</u> Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions to install Docker on your machine. This may involve accepting terms of service, choosing installation options, and providing administrative privileges.

- <u>Launch Docker:</u> Once the installation is complete, launch the Docker application. On some operating systems, Docker may start automatically after installation.

- <u>Verify Installation:</u> Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command to verify that Docker is installed correctly:

```
docker --version
```

This command should display the version of Docker installed on your machine.

2. **Step 2: Configure Docker (Optional)**

Depending on your operating system and use case, you may need to configure Docker for optimal performance or to suit your specific requirements. Here are some optional configuration steps you can consider:


- Adjust Resources: Docker allows you to allocate system resources (CPU, memory) to the containers it runs. By default, Docker assigns a portion of your machine's resources. You can adjust these settings based on your needs.

- Configure Networking: Docker provides networking options to control how containers communicate with each other and the outside world. You can configure port mappings, network drivers, or create custom networks.

- Enable Docker at Startup: If you want Docker to start automatically when you boot up your machine, configure Docker to launch at startup. This avoids the need to manually start Docker each time you want to use it.

Refer to the Docker documentation or the Docker website for detailed instructions on configuring Docker for your specific operating system.

3. **Step 3: Test Docker Installation**

To ensure that Docker is installed correctly and running smoothly, follow these steps:

- Open a Terminal or Command Prompt: Launch a terminal or command prompt on your machine.

- Run Docker Hello World: In the terminal or command prompt, enter the following command:

```
docker run hello-world
```

Docker will download a small test image, create a container, and execute it. You should see output confirming a successful Docker installation.

- Verify Docker Images: To verify that the Docker image was downloaded and stored locally, run the following command:

```
docker images
```
This command will list the Docker images available on your machine, including the "hello-world" image.

Congratulations! You have successfully set up Docker on your machine. You are now ready to start using Docker containers to package and deploy your applications.

## **_Docker Development Environments:_**

Docker provides an efficient way to create isolated and reproducible development environments for your projects. With Docker, you can package your application, its dependencies, and development tools into containers, ensuring consistency across different development machines. This documentation outlines the steps to set up a Docker development environment for your project.

- **Prerequisites**

Before setting up a Docker development environment, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

1. <u>Docker Engine:</u> Download and install Docker Engine for your operating system by following the official installation instructions from the Docker website.

- **Docker Compose**

Docker Compose is a tool that allows you to define and manage multi-container Docker applications. It uses a YAML file to specify the services, networks, and volumes required for your development environment. Follow these steps to set up Docker Compose for your project:

1. <u>Create a Docker Compose File:</u> Create a docker-compose.yml file in the root directory of your project. This file will define your development environment.

2. <u>Define Services:</u> In the Docker Compose file, specify the services required for your development environment. This can include your application service, databases, cache servers, or any other dependencies. Each service should be defined with its own configuration, including the Docker image to use and any environment variables or volume mounts required.

3. <u>Configure Networks:</u> If your services need to communicate with each other, define custom networks in the Docker Compose file. This allows you to isolate the containers and control their network access.

4. <u>Set up Volumes:</u> Use Docker volumes to persist data between container restarts or to share data between the host machine and the container. Define volume mounts in the Docker Compose file for each service that requires data persistence or sharing.

5. <u>Build and Run Services:</u> Use the docker-compose command to build and run the defined services. Open a terminal or command prompt in the same directory as the Docker Compose file and run the following command:

```
docker-compose up
```
Docker Compose will start the containers and display the logs for each service in the terminal.

6. <u>Access the Development Environment:</u> Once the services are up and running, you can access your development environment using the specified ports or network configurations. Open a web browser or make requests to the appropriate endpoints to interact with your application.

## **_Additional Configuration:_**

Depending on your project's requirements, you may need to configure additional aspects of your Docker development environment. Consider the following:

1. <u>Development Tools:</u> Install any development tools or utilities required for your project inside the Docker containers. This can include code editors, debuggers, linters, or testing frameworks.

2. <u>Development Workflows:</u> Document any specific workflows or commands that developers should follow when working with the Docker development environment. This may include instructions for running tests, debugging, or accessing logs within the containers.

3. <u>Hot Reloading:</u> Explore options for enabling hot reloading or automatic code reloading within the containers to enhance the development experience and eliminate the need for manual container restarts.

4. <u>Integration with Version Control:</u> Provide guidelines on how to integrate Docker into your version control workflow. This may involve including Docker-related files, such as the Docker Compose file or Dockerfile, in your version control repository.
