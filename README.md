### Commonly used tools to aid in Zethicâ€™s project development:

## **_Development tools overview:_**

1. <u>Integrated Development Environments (IDEs):</u> Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) are software applications that provide comprehensive tools and features to support the development process. Some popular IDEs include:
- **Visual Studio Code:** A lightweight, cross-platform IDE with powerful code editing features, debugging capabilities, and extensive plugin ecosystem.
- **IntelliJ IDEA:** A Java-centric IDE that offers intelligent code completion, debugging, refactoring tools, and support for various programming languages and frameworks.
- **Eclipse:** A highly customizable IDE that supports multiple languages and offers a range of plugins for different development purposes.

2. <u>Package Managers:</u> Package managers automate the process of managing software dependencies, making it easier to install, update, and remove libraries or modules required by a project. Popular package managers include:
- **npm:** The default package manager for Node.js, providing a vast ecosystem of reusable packages and modules.
- **pip:** The package manager for Python, used to install and manage Python libraries.
- **Composer:** A dependency manager for PHP, allowing developers to declare and manage project dependencies.

3. <u>Build Tools:</u> Build tools automate the compilation, testing, and packaging of source code into deployable artifacts. Some commonly used build tools are: 
- **Gradle:** A powerful build automation tool that supports multiple programming languages and provides flexibility and scalability.
- **Maven:** A widely used build automation and dependency management tool primarily used for Java projects.
- **Webpack:** A module bundler that helps manage and optimize the frontend assets, such as JavaScript, CSS, and images.

## **_Set up your browser to make your work easy:_**

Configuring Google Chrome for development can greatly improve your workflow and productivity. Follow these steps to set up Google Chrome for development purposes:

1. <u>Install Google Chrome:</u> Download and install the latest version of Google Chrome from the official website [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/).

2. <u>Developer Tools:</u> Google Chrome comes with built-in developer tools that provide a range of features for web development. To access the developer tools: 
- Right-click anywhere on a web page.
- Select "Inspect" or "Inspect Element" from the context menu.
- Alternatively, use the keyboard shortcut **Ctrl + Shift + I** (Windows/Linux) or **Command + Option + I** (Mac). 

The developer tools panel will open, allowing you to explore its various tabs and functionalities.

3. <u>Extensions:</u> Chrome extensions can enhance your development experience. Here are some useful extensions: 
- **Web Developer:** Provides a suite of web development tools, including resizing the browser window, analyzing CSS, disabling JavaScript, and more.
- **JSON Viewer:** Formats and validates JSON data, making it easier to read and debug.
- **Wappalyzer:** Identifies the technologies and frameworks used by a website.
- **ColorZilla:** Allows you to pick colors from web pages, generate gradients, and inspect element colors.

To install an extension: 

- Open the Chrome Web Store [Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore) in Google Chrome.
- Search for the desired extension by name.
- Click on the extension and click the "Add to Chrome" button to install it.
- Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.
- Once installed, the extension's icon will appear in your browser toolbar.

## **_Disable caching:_**

During web development, it's often necessary to disable caching to ensure that you're viewing the most up-to-date version of your web pages and resources. Disabling caching allows you to see the changes you've made without relying on cached files. Here's how you can disable caching in the developer tools of popular browsers:

**Google Chrome**

1. Open the Chrome browser.
2. Launch the Developer Tools:
* Right-click anywhere on a web page.
* Select "Inspect" or "Inspect Element" from the context menu.
* Alternatively, use the keyboard shortcut **Ctrl + Shift + I** (Windows/Linux) or **Command + Option + I** (Mac).
With the Developer Tools panel open, ensure that the "Network" tab is selected.
Check the "Disable cache" checkbox at the top-left corner of the Developer Tools panel. This will enable cache disabling for subsequent page loads.
