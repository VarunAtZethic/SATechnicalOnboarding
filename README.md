# Git Version Control System
### How to install and use Git for version control in Zethic projects

## **_Introduction to Git:_**

Git allows developers to keep a historical record of changes made to their codebase, providing a reliable and efficient way to track and manage versions. Key concepts in Git include:

1. <u>Repository:</u> A repository, or repo, is a collection of files and their entire history. It serves as a centralized hub for collaboration and version control.

2. <u>Commit:</u> A commit represents a specific set of changes made to the codebase. Each commit is identified by a unique hash and contains information such as the author, timestamp, and commit message.

3. <u>Branch:</u> A branch is a parallel version of the codebase that allows developers to work on features or bug fixes independently. Branches enable concurrent development and can be merged back into the main codebase.

4. <u>Merge:</u> Merging combines changes from one branch into another, typically integrating feature branches into the main branch (often called the "master" or "main" branch).

5. <u>Pull Request:</u> A pull request (PR) is a mechanism for proposing changes from one branch to another. It allows team members to review, discuss, and provide feedback before merging the changes.

6. <u>Remote:</u> A remote refers to a repository hosted on a server, such as GitHub or GitLab. Developers can push their local changes to a remote repository and pull changes from it to stay up to date with the latest code.

## **_Setting up Git for the project:_**

To start using Git, follow these steps to set it up on your development machine:

1. <u>Installation:</u> Download and install Git from the official Git website [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads). Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

2. <u>Configuration:</u> After installation, open a terminal or command prompt and configure your Git identity with the following commands:

```
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "yourname@example.com"
```
Replace "Your Name" and "yourname@example.com" with your preferred name and email address, respectively.

3. <u>Optional:</u> Remote Repository: If you plan to collaborate with others or host your code on a remote repository platform like GitHub or GitLab, create a new repository and obtain its URL.

- **Initialize a Repository:** Open a terminal or command prompt in your project's root directory and run the following command to initialize a Git repository:

```
git init
```
- **Add and Commit Changes:** Use the following commands to stage and commit changes:

```
git add <file1> <file2> ...  # Stage specific files
git add .                    # Stage all files
git commit -m "Commit message"
```
Replace <file1>, <file2>, etc., with the names of the files you want to stage. The commit message should be a concise description of the changes.

- **Creating a branch on git:** You will likely create your new branch from the master branch for all new features/bugs/hotfixes/fixes unless specified otherwise.

The steps to create a new branch are:

- Checkout to the base branch that is ‘master’ (or any other if required) ``git checkout master``
- Fetch all latest changes ``git fetch –all``
- Switch the branch to the new branch that you are going to work on ``git switch -c BRANCH_NAME``

1. Writing a Commit Message:
- chore:* -> Any Regular Changes
- fix:* -> Fix of any type
- feat:* -> New Feature
- docs:* -> Documentation
- test:* -> Test cases
- Try:* -> If you are trying something which you might need to revert
- refactor:* -> If you are refactoring the code

Please do mention in the commit if there are any breaking changes like new env variables or package updates/installs.

You can also practice writing the commit descriptions. If there are more than two points to write in the description, split it into commits.

Ref: [DEV](https://dev.to/puritanic/how-are-you-writing-a-commit-message-1ih7)

2. Creating a Pull Request: Create the pull request for the task that you push to the remote (Github / GitLab).

- **Title** -> Task name from Task tracking tool. (Clickup/Jira)
- **Description** ->Description of the task.

Provide the task name and mention any additional steps required to be done pre-deployment or post-deployment like:

1. Migration needed
2. Add the task to the queue/Jobs
3. Any command that is required to run with a description of why it is required
4. Any env variable that is added. etc.


- **Create and Switch Branches:** To create a new branch and switch to it, use the following command:

```
git checkout -b <branch-name>
```
Replace <branch-name> with a meaningful name for your branch.

- **Push and Pull Changes:** If you're working with a remote repository, you can use the following commands to push your local changes and pull updates from the remote:

```
git push origin <branch-name>    # Push changes to the remote
```

1. <u>Create a Documentation Folder:</u> Set up a dedicated folder within your project repository to store all documentation files.
2. <u>Commit Documentation Changes:</u> Treat your documentation files like any other code file in your project. Use `git add` and `git commit` to track changes and commit new versions of your documentation.
3. <u>Use Descriptive Commit Messages:</u> Write clear and concise commit messages that describe the purpose and content of the documentation changes. This helps other developers understand the intent behind each commit.

**Commit Messages for Documentation:**

Writing informative and meaningful commit messages is essential for maintaining a well-documented project history. Consider the following best practices when writing commit messages for documentation:

1. <u>Be Descriptive:</u> Clearly describe the purpose of the documentation changes in the commit message. Use present tense and succinctly summarize the modifications.
2. <u>Include Relevant Context:</u> Provide additional context or references, such as issue numbers or related documentation, in the commit message. This helps others understand the context behind the changes.
3. <u>Consider Length and Readability:</u> Keep commit messages concise, but ensure they convey enough information. Avoid excessively long messages that may be difficult to read or understand.

**Documentation File Organization**

Organizing your documentation files in a logical and structured manner helps developers navigate and find information easily. Consider the following guidelines for organizing your documentation files:

1. <u>Use a Consistent Structure:</u> Define a consistent structure for organizing different types of documentation files, such as user guides, API documentation, or project README files. This makes it easier for developers to locate specific information.
2. <u>Create Separate Files for Different Topics:</u> Split your documentation into separate files for different topics or sections. For example, have separate files for installation instructions, configuration, usage guides, and troubleshooting.
3. <u>Use Descriptive Filenames:</u> Give your documentation files meaningful and descriptive names. Use lowercase letters, hyphens, or underscores to separate words for better readability.
4. <u>Include Table of Contents:</u> For larger documentation sets, consider adding a table of contents or an index file that provides an overview of all available documentation and serves as an entry point for users.

By following these guidelines, you can effectively document your project on Git, ensuring that important information is well-preserved, easily accessible, and accurately versioned. This helps both current and future developers understand and maintain the project with clarity and efficiency.

# **APIs**

### Project has many APIs that make it easy to alter and extend, and to help developers with common tasks. Learn how to use them in your code.

## **_RESTful API Structure Documentation:_**

This documentation provides guidelines and best practices for structuring a RESTful API in your project. A well-structured API promotes consistency, scalability, and ease of use for developers consuming your API. Follow the guidelines below to structure your RESTful API effectively:

- **API Design Principles:**

1. <u>Use Standard HTTP Methods:</u> Design your API endpoints around standard HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE. Map each method to the corresponding CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

2. <u>Resource-Oriented Design:</u> Structure your API around resources. A resource is an object or concept that can be uniquely identified, such as "users," "products," or "orders." Use nouns to name your endpoints and make them represent resources.

3. <u>Use Plural Nouns:</u> Use plural nouns in your endpoint URLs to represent collections of resources. For example, /users represents a collection of users.

4. <u>Versioning:</u> Consider versioning your API to ensure backward compatibility as your API evolves. Include the version number in the URL, such as /v1/users.

5. <u>Use Proper Status Codes:</u> Return appropriate HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of a request. For example, use 200 for successful GET requests, 201 for successful POST requests, and 404 for resources not found.

6. <u>Error Handling:</u> Define a consistent error handling mechanism to provide meaningful error messages and error codes to API consumers. Include error details in the response body and use appropriate HTTP status codes for different error scenarios.

- **API Structure:**

Here is a suggested structure for organizing your API endpoints:

1. <u>Authentication and Authorization:</u> Include endpoints for user authentication and authorization, such as /login and /register. These endpoints typically handle user authentication and provide access tokens or session cookies for subsequent requests.

2. <u>Resources:</u> Define endpoints for each resource in your system. Use plural nouns to represent collections of resources and singular nouns for specific resource instances. For example:

- /users: Endpoint for managing user resources.
- /users/{id}: Endpoint for managing a specific user by their unique identifier.

3. <u>Nested Resources:</u> If there are relationships between resources, consider using nested endpoints to represent those relationships. For example:

- /users/{userId}/posts: Endpoint for retrieving posts associated with a specific user.
- /posts/{postId}/comments: Endpoint for retrieving comments associated with a specific post.

4. <u>Pagination:</u> If your API returns large collections of resources, consider implementing pagination to improve performance. Include query parameters like page and limit to control the number of results returned.

5. <u>Filters and Sorting:</u> Allow API consumers to filter and sort resources based on specific criteria. Use query parameters to specify filters and sorting options.

6. <u>Endpoint Naming Conventions:</u> Use consistent and intuitive naming conventions for your endpoints. Aim for clarity and simplicity to make it easier for developers to understand and use your API.

7. <u>Request and Response Formats:</u> Clearly document the request and response formats for each endpoint, including the expected data types, headers, and any required or optional parameters.

8. <u>Error Handling:</u> Define a standardized format for error responses, including error codes, error messages, and additional error details if necessary.

9. <u>Versioning:</u> If you plan to introduce breaking changes to your API in the future, consider implementing versioning strategies. This allows API consumers to migrate to newer versions of the API at their own pace while maintaining backward compatibility.

10. <u>Documentation:</u> Provide comprehensive documentation that describes each endpoint, its purpose, required parameters, and expected responses. Include example requests and responses to illustrate how to interact with your API.

## **_Laravel API Structure Documentation:_**

This documentation provides guidelines and best practices for structuring a Laravel API in your project. Laravel is a popular PHP framework that offers powerful tools and features for building robust and scalable APIs. Follow the guidelines below to structure your Laravel API effectively:

- **API Design Principles:**

1. <u>Use RESTful Principles:</u> Design your API endpoints following RESTful principles. Use standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE) to perform CRUD operations on resources.

2. <u>Resource-Oriented Design:</u> Structure your API around resources. Each endpoint should represent a resource, and the URL should use plural nouns to represent collections of resources.

3. <u>Use Proper HTTP Status Codes:</u> Return appropriate HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of a request. Use 200 for successful responses, 201 for resource creation, 204 for successful but empty responses, and appropriate error codes (e.g., 400, 404, 500) for error scenarios.

4. <u>Implement Pagination:</u> If your API returns large collections of resources, implement pagination to improve performance. Include query parameters (e.g., page, limit) to control the number of results returned.

5. <u>Handle Errors and Exceptions:</u> Implement proper error handling and exception management to provide meaningful error responses to API consumers. Use Laravel's exception handling mechanisms to catch and handle exceptions gracefully.

6. <u>Authentication and Authorization:</u> Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms to secure your API endpoints. Use Laravel's built-in authentication features (e.g., Laravel Passport, JWT) or third-party libraries to handle authentication and access control.

- **API Structure:**

Here is a suggested structure for organizing your Laravel API:

1. <u>Routes:</u> Define your API routes in the routes/api.php file. Use Laravel's route definitions to map URLs to controller methods. Organize your routes based on resources and their corresponding controllers.

2. <u>Controllers:</u> Create controllers to handle each resource of your API. Use resource-specific controllers to group related functionality. Follow Laravel's naming conventions for controllers and methods.

3. <u>Models:</u> Define models that represent your database tables or collections. Models allow you to interact with the database and perform operations like retrieving, creating, updating, and deleting records.

4. <u>Requests:</u> Create request classes to handle request validation. Use Laravel's form request validation or custom request classes to validate incoming requests and ensure the data is valid before processing.

5. <u>Transformers:</u> Implement transformers to transform your model data into a standardized format (e.g., JSON) for API responses. Transformers allow you to control the structure and presentation of your API data.

6. <u>Services or Repositories:</u> Use services or repositories to encapsulate complex business logic and keep your controllers lean. Services handle the main business logic of your application, while repositories interact with the database or external data sources.

7. <u>Middleware:</u> Implement middleware to handle cross-cutting concerns such as authentication, authorization, rate limiting, or request/response modification. Laravel provides middleware that you can use out of the box or create custom middleware as per your requirements.

8. <u>Response Formatting:</u> Use Laravel's response helpers or create custom response classes to format your API responses consistently. This ensures that API consumers receive responses in a standardized format.

9. <u>Validation:</u> Leverage Laravel's validation features to validate incoming data. Use validation rules to ensure the integrity and correctness of the data provided by API consumers.

10. <u>Error Handling:</u> Customize Laravel's exception handling to provide meaningful error responses. Create custom exception classes for specific types of errors and define how they should be transformed into API responses.

11. <u>Documentation:</U> Provide comprehensive documentation that describes each endpoint, its purpose, required parameters, and expected responses. Include examples of request and response payloads to assist API consumers in using your API effectively.
